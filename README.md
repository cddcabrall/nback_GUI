# nback_GUI
A flexible programmable secondary task is provided as a modified version of N-Back. This GUI allows the experimenter to setup a visual manual N-back task that requires participants to key in responses when presented with a prompt “?????” asking them what was the target number seen 1 time, 2 times, or 3 times ago
